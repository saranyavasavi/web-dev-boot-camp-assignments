        The plates will still shift<br>
        and the clouds will still spew.<br>
        The sun will slowly rise<br>
        and the moon will follow too<br><br>
        Lifeâ€™s beauty will continue<br>
        to flourish all around,<br>
        but now you are gone,<br>
        these birds have no sound.<br>
